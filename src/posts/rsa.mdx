# Understanding RSA

RSA is one of the first public-key encryption algorithms ever used.
For this reason, it serves well as a pedagogical example for readers curious about **cryptography**.

In this post, I’ll focus more on the mathematical aspects of RSA and specifically **number theory**.

---

## Let’s begin by understanding the system.

RSA relies on a **pair of keys**: one **public**, which can be shared openly, and one **private**, which must be kept secret by its owner.

The standard example involves Bob and Alice exchanging messages.  
Since they want to encrypt their communication using RSA, each of them has such a key pair.

Confident in the system, Alice wants to send a message to Bob. She uses Bob’s **public key** to **encrypt** the message.

At this point, Bob (<u>and Bob only</u>) can **decrypt** the message using his **private key**.

The security of this system relies on the fact that Bob's private key is known only to him.

Using this private key, Bob can decrypt messages that were encrypted with his corresponding public key through a fascinating
mathematical process based on **modular arithmetic**.

## Key Generation

Generating such public/private key pairs involves fundamental number theory concepts, particularly **prime numbers**.  
You may recall that a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1, divisible only by 1 and itself.

<CalloutBox type="example" title="Prime">
  $3$ and $7$ are prime numbers, while $21$ is not. It can be expressed as a
  product of primes: $3 \times 7$.
</CalloutBox>

Prime numbers are the **atoms** of the integers. Every positive integer can be constructed as a product of primes (factorization).

<CalloutBox type="example" title="Prime factorization">
  $21 = 7 \times 3$ or $3 \times 7$
</CalloutBox>

This is formalized in a famous result known as the **Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic**, or **Unique Factorization Theorem (UFT)**.

<CalloutBox type="theorem" title="Unique Factorization Theorem">
  Every positive integer can be uniquely factorized (up to ordering) into its
  **prime factors**.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="remark" title="">
  Notice that 1 is not included in the theorem’s statement, as it can be seen as
  a product of no primes.
</CalloutBox>

Another example of prime factorization:

<CalloutBox type="example" title="Prime factorization">
  $6615 = 3^3 \times 7^2 \times 5$
</CalloutBox>

Now let’s return to RSA and the **key generation process**.  
Bob can generate a pair of keys using the following steps:

<CalloutBox type="definition" title="RSA Key Generation">
  <ol>
    <li>Choose two primes: $p$ and $q$</li>
    <li>Compute $n = p \times q$</li>
    <li>Compute $\phi(n) = (p − 1)(q − 1)$</li>
    <li>Choose $e$ such that $1 < e < \phi(n)$ where $e$ is coprime to $\phi(n)$ ($gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$)</li>
    <li>Find $d$ such that $e \times d = 1 \mod \phi(n)$</li>
    <li>The public key is $(e, n)$; the private key consists of $(d, p, q)$</li>
  </ol>
</CalloutBox>

Some of these steps rely on concepts we haven’t yet defined.  
Let’s walk through them one by one.

### Step 1: Choose two primes

Bob first chooses two distinct prime numbers: $p$ and $q$.

These primes should be large enough (at least 20 digits) to ensure the system’s security.  
It is **notoriously difficult** to factor the product of two large primes and this is the basis of RSA’s strength.

### Step 2: Compute $n = p \times q$

This is straightforward.

### Step 3: Compute $\phi(n) = (p − 1)(q − 1)$

Here we introduce $\phi(n)$, the **Euler's totient function**.

<CalloutBox type="definition" title="Euler's Totient Function">
  Given a positive integer $n$, the totient function $\phi(n)$ counts the number
  of integers from $0$ to $n - 1$ that are **coprime** to $n$. By convention,
  $\phi(1) = 1$.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="example" title="">
  $\phi(12) = 4$ because the integers $1, 5, 7$, and $11$ are coprime to $12$.
</CalloutBox>

But what does “coprime” mean?

Two positive integers are **coprime** if they have no common prime factors other than 1.

In particular, if $n$ is a prime number, then $\phi(n) = n - 1$. Why?

It also follows that when $p$ and $q$ are coprime (distinct primes are coprime)
$\phi(n) = (p − 1)(q − 1)$.

Note: computing $\phi(n)$ from just $n$ would require factoring $n$, which is copmputationlly hard (recall step 1) if you don't know $p$ and $q$.

### Step 4: Choose $e$ such that $1 < e < \phi(n)$ where $e$ is coprime to $\phi(n)$ ($gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$)$

Now Bob must choose an **exponent** $e$.

It should satisfy:

- $1 < e < \phi(n)$
- $e$ is coprime to $\phi(n)$ or, algorithmically, $gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$

A common choice is $e = 2^{16} + 1$ (65,537); large enough for security, small enough for efficiency.

To check whether $e$ and $\phi(n)$ are coprime, Bob can use the **greatest common divisor (gcd)**.

<CalloutBox type="definition" title="GCD">
  The **greatest common divisor** of two integers is the largest positive
  integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="example" title="GCD">
  The gcd of $12$ and $15$ is $3$, since it divides both without a remainder.
</CalloutBox>

To compute the gcd, Bob can use the **Euclidean algorithm**, one of the oldest known algorithms (from _Elements_, c. 300 BC).
The algorithm is based on the following principle:

<CalloutBox type="theorem" title="">
  If $a \neq 0$ and $b = aq + r$ for some $q$ and $r$, then $$ \gcd(a, b) =
  \gcd(a, r) $$
</CalloutBox>

It's extremely easy top write the algorithm in javascript:

1. Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers (swap if $b > a$)
2. If $b = 0$, then $\gcd(a, b) = a$
3. Otherwise, replace $a$ with $b$, and $b$ with $r$
4. Repeat until $b = 0$

$r$ is the reminder computed using javascript [remainder operator `%`](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-11.5.2).
The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.

```ts
function gcd(a, b) {
  return b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

Notice the nice recursion!
Now, Bob can algorithmically determine whether two integers are **coprime**:

<CalloutBox type="definition" title="Coprime">
  Two integers are <strong>coprime</strong> if their greatest common divisor
  (gcd) is 1.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="example" title="Coprime">
  The integers 8 and 15 are coprime because their gcd is 1.
</CalloutBox>

### Step 5: Find $d$ such that $e \times d = 1 \mod \phi(n)$

The equation $e \times d = 1 \mod \phi(n)$ must be read as
$e \times d$ is congruent $1$ modulo $\phi(n)$.

We now delve into modular arithmetic, starting with its foundation:
**modular congruence**.

<CalloutBox type="definition" title="Modular Congruence">
  Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, and let $m$ be a positive integer. We say that
  $a$ is <strong>congruent</strong> to $b$ modulo $m$ (written as $a = b \mod
  m$), if there exists an integer $k$ such that: $a = b + km$.
</CalloutBox>

Nothe: $b$ is the **remainder** when dividing $a$ by $m$.

JavaScript doesn’t have a true `mod` operator, only a **remainder operator** `%`, which behaves slightly differently for negative numbers.  
(See [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25726760/javascript-modular-arithmetic)).

There is anyway a [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-integer-and-modulus-math).

Now, the equation  
$e \times d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)$  
can be rewritten as:  
$d = e^{-1} \mod \phi(n)$

That is: $d$ is the **modular inverse** of $e$ modulo $\phi(n)$.

Such a modular inverse exists **only if** $e$ and $\phi(n)$ are coprime (and by step 4 they are).

To compute $d$, Bob can use the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**, a standard method for finding modular inverses.

- [Here’s a nice explanation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/module-inverse.html)
- Or see [this one on Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/wiki/extended-euclidean-algorithm/)

For theoretical reasons, I'll introduce a more elegant method based on **Euler's Theorem**,
which provides deeper insight into why RSA encryption\decription works so smootlhy.

<CalloutBox type="theorem" title="Euler's Theorem">
  Let $m$ be a positive integer. For any integer $a$ that is coprime to $m$, we have:  
  $$a^{\phi(m)} = 1 \mod m$$
</CalloutBox>

Since Bob knows $\phi(n)$, he can use Euler's Theorem to compute $e^{-1}$:

$$
  e^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n
$$

This implies:

$$
  e^{\phi(n) - 1} \equiv e^{-1} \mod n
$$

So Bob can compute:

$$
  d = e^{\phi(n) - 1} \mod \phi(n)
$$

to obtain the **modular inverse**.

$e^{\phi(n) - 1}$ is calculated through the fast [exponentiation algorithm](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/modular-exponentiation) (also known as exponentiation by squaring or binary exponentiation)

## Encryption/Decritpion

### Encryption

Now Bob have already shared his public-key $(e,n)$ to Alice.

Alice will be able to send a message to Bob in the following way:

- She converts the message into a series of chuncks, each of wich is represented by an integer $m$ ranging from $1$ to $n$
- To **encrypt** each chunk $c$, she compute
  $$
    c = m^{e} \mod n
  $$

### Decritpion

Bob can decrypt each received chuncks using the formula:

$$
  c^d \mod n = (m^e)^d \mod n = m^{de} \mod n
$$

Remeber that $d$ is the modular inverse of $e$. Thus $de = 1 \mod \phi(n)$.

We introduce Euler's Theorem for a reason, infact, in number theory it's used erytime
in order when dealing with powers as it reduces complexity a lot.
